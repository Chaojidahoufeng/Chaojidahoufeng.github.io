I'm a fourth year Ph.D candidate from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes reinforcement learning in both LLMs and robotics, alignment and generative models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuan Shen](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~shenyuan) in SGroup from [Institute of Information Systems, EE](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Research/Research_Institutes/Institute_of_Information_System.htm), Tsinghua University. I am also very fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Yu Wang](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/YuWang) and [Prof. Jian Wang](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangjian1/zh_CN/index.htm) to contribute to the development of Collaborative Intelligence Group.

Recently, I am interning in the RLHF group in [Baichuan AI](https://www.baichuan-ai.com/home), working on developing robust RLHF/alignment algorithms. Before that, I interned in Machine Learning Group, Microsoft Asia Research, mentored by [Xu Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tob-U1oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Tao Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bl4SRU0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

Starting from October 2024, I will start a six-month visiting scholar program at UIUC, hosted by [Prof. Tamer Basar](https://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/). I plan to finish my Ph.D program in 2026 and will be open for the job/internship opportunities regarding LLM/Multimodal LM/embodied-AI in late 2025.
